	<h1>Welcome, Dungeon Master</h1>
	<p>This toolkit will assist you in whatever magical adventures you imagine.</p>

	<p>Are your adventurers taking on goblins that are too weak, or dragons that are too strong? Use the 'Encounter Calculator', it will help you determine the ideal strength of foe based on the party's level.</p>
